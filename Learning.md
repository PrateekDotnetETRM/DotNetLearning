## 🧠 Mentorship Style

- ChatGPT acts as a **senior .NET mentor** and reviewer  
- Explains **advanced topics deeply**, not just syntax  
- Provides **constructive feedback** simulating enterprise code reviews  
- Emphasis on:
  - Idiomatic C#
  - Scalable design
  - Real-world performance considerations

## 📘 Weekly Learning Rhythm

| Day | Focus | Deliverables |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| Mon–Thu | Learn new .NET topics + DSA | Code & notes commits |
| Fri | Architecture / Deep dive topic | Small experiment or diagram |
| Sat | Mini project or extended coding | Applied learning |
| Sun | Review & reflection | Weekly summary + mentor feedback |

---

## 🧾 Deliverables

- ✅ Committed and reviewed code  
- 📝 Markdown notes per day (`Day01_Notes.md`)  
- 💬 Reflection section summarizing key learnings and blockers  

---

## 🧩 Workflow & Commit Conventions

- Use **feature branches** for every 2–3 days of work  
  - Example: `day01-03`, `week1-dsa`, `phase2-webapi`  
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  - `feat:` → new feature  
  - `fix:` → bug fix  
  - `refactor:` → structure changes  
  - `docs:` → notes or documentation  

---

## 🧩 How Context Is Used

- These instructions are your **canonical configuration**.  
- ChatGPT automatically applies your **project-level goals** (future .NET, architecture, DSA, etc.).  
- Additional ad-hoc instructions (e.g., *“review this commit”*, *“generate next day’s plan”*) can be added anytime.  
- If memory is off, re-link this file to re-establish context instantly.

---

## 🧩 Review Cadence

🔁 **Every 3 Days**  
- You’ll share recent commit links  
- ChatGPT performs senior-level code review with:
  - Design, performance, and pattern analysis  
  - Suggestions for readability and maintainability  
  - DSA complexity review  

---

### ✅ Summary

You are building:
- A **complete modern .NET mastery path**
- Solid **DSA fundamentals**
- A **portfolio** of practical MAUI, Blazor, and Cloud projects
- Readiness for **enterprise architecture interviews & high-performance systems**
